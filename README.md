>
>2. in a mircowave-safe bowl, heat the chocolate chips and oil on high for a minute, or until melted. mix well to combine the ingredients without any lumps 
>
>3. preheat the pan on high. 
>
>4. whisk the sugatr, vanilla extract, almond milk and oil together in a big bowl (the dry ingredients will end up here). combine the flour, baking powder, salt and cornstarch in a separate bowl. whisk the dry ingredients into the wet ingredient one half at a time. if the batter seems too thick, add more almond milk for a light (almost light cream) texture.
>
>5. when the pan is hot enough, pour the batter tablespoon at a time. smoothen the batter out by using the back of the spoon. let the batter cook for 3 minutes on the first side, or till you see bubbples formed around the edges. flip the shell and allow to cook for another minute or two, then transfer to a plate.

>6. on each shell, stuff with raspberry preserves, drizzle with the chocolate ganache, then finish it off with the powdered sugar (optional).
