>#### Although 2 hours can seem like an awfully long time to spend on a meal, this dish only needs your attention during the first and last 10 minutes of the time, allowing you to binge-watch your shows on Netflix while the pork does its own thing in the oven. By using Coca-Cola, it will allow you to cut away many ingredients for flavouring and balances out the salty flavour of the soy sauce.



**Ingredients**
- 700g pork shoulder joint

- 2 1/2 cup (280ml) Coca-Cola 

- 1 cup (130ml) soy sauce

- 1/5 cup (30g) dark brown sugar

- 8 plain non-filled bao buns 
  * you are more than welcome to make your own bao buns by following the recipes from [BBC good food recipe](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/steamed-bao-buns)

- 1 packet of salad leaves

- 4 spring onions (just the green part)

_*3 chilis optional_

>1. Set the oven to **200Â°C.**
>
>2. Place the pork joint in a deep oven tray and pour in the coke, soy sauce and the brown sugar. Mix it well, then put it in the oven for 2 hours.
>
>3. Wash up the salad, spring onions and chilies, then cut up the spring onions and chilies into small pieces
>
>4. Steam the bao buns for 10 minutes (follow the instructions on the package). 
>
>5. Take the pork joint out and cut it up to slices
>
